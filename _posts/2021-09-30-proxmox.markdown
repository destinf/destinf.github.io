# Proxmox

I recently learned about [Proxmox](https://www.proxmox.com) after a coworker told me about [unraid](https://unraid.net).
Previously I was inspired by the [Homelab subreddit](https://reddit.com/r/homelab) to run my own homelab, which I did using an old laptop running [k3s](https://k3s.io), with everything dockerized.

## First point of confusion
First thing I did was try to spin up a container. I started off a bit confused because due to my previous homelab, I just assumed that they were talking about docker containers. Really though, proxmox supports Linux Containers.
Luckily, I found the built-in Container Templates pretty quickly and soon had my first container running inside my Proxmox system.

## Importing my existing system
I wanted a way to quickly import my existing system into proxmox, as I had a ton of stuff configured.
As much ease of use as k3s provided to potentially add new nodes, I definitely did some crazy stuff on top of it.
For example, I wanted to mount an external NAS so that some of the k3s pods could access it.
I had automounting all set up inside my old system, and I didn't really want to bothering reconfiguring it.

### Clonezilla
Luckily, Proxmox has a [guide to migrating servers into Proxmox](https://pve.proxmox.com/wiki/Migration_of_servers_to_Proxmox_VE).
I grabbed a copy of the Clonezilla Live image, ran one on my old laptop server and another in a VM in Proxmox.
Admittedly I got confused at first with the different options, and a lot of the help guides online weren't up to date, mentioning menu items that didn't exist in the current iteration of Clonezilla.
In short:
Old Laptop Server -> Clonezilla(load into ram) -> remote-source
New Proxmox VM -> Clonezilla(load into ram) -> remote-dest -> Enter IP Address of the Old Laptop Server (it will show in the Old Laptop Server console messages)

First few times, it finished way too quickly to have copied over 480 GB of data. Checking the new VM it definitely didn't work.
I figured out that I should set the clonezilla cloning tool to enter the command line after the operations were done.
Checked the /var/log/clonezilla directory, and figured out that I had set the HD size in the VM to way too small of a size.
Resized the VM HD to something larger than the 480 GB of the Old Laptop Server, and it got to work copying!

After checking successfully copying, I checked the amount of data in the VM, and I definitely don't need to have 480+ GB allocated. Next step will be to shrink the HD size!
